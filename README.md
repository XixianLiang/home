## PBFDroid

PBFDroid is an automated GUI testing tool to support the application of our property-based fuzzing approach, which can effectively find data manipulation errors.


### Download

```
git clone https://github.com/property-based-fuzzing/home.git
```

### Environment

If your system has the following support, you can directly run PBFDroid 
- Android SDK: API 26+
- Python 3.7
We use some python libraries, you can install them as prompted, for example:
```
pip install langid
```
You need to create an emulator before running PBFDroid. See [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43275238/how-to-set-system-images-path-when-creating-an-android-avd) to find out how to create avd using [avdmanager](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/avdmanager).
The following sample command illustrates how to create an emulatorï¼š
```
sdkmanager "system-images;android-26;google_apis;x86"
avdmanager create avd --force --name Android8.0 --package 'system-images;android-26;google_apis;x86' --abi google_apis/x86 --sdcard 512M --device "pixel_xl"
```
Next, you can start an emulator with the following commands:
```
emulator -avd Android8.0 -read-only -port 5554 
```

### Run

#### Detect DMEs ([video tutorial](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AinXMMnLw-UDmWB_83VqFoaMWVzu?e=POiJTf))
If you have downloaded our project and configured the environment, you only need to enter "download_path/home" to execute our sample app with the following command:
```
python code/start.py -app_path app/anymemo.apk -json_name _anymemo -device_serial emulator-5554 -root_path download_path/home -choice 1 -event_num 400 -max_time 57600 -result_path output
```
Here, 
* `-app_path` path of the app under test (AUT). 
* `-json_name` name of the folder that stores the AUT's DMFs
* `-root_path` up-level directory of the folder that stores all DMFs
* `-choice` 1: run property-based fuzzing to detect DMEs, 2: record DMFs
* `-event_num` number of events in each test
* `-max_time` allocates the running time of PBFDroid (in seconds)

#### Record DMF ([video tutorial](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AinXMMnLw-UDmWB_83VqFoaMWVzu?e=POiJTf))
You can start the DMF instantiator module for defining DMF with the following command:
```
python code/start.py -root_path dmf/ -choice 2 -app_path app/APPNAME.apk -json_name _activitydiary -device_serial emulator-5554
```

### User manual

Before conducting user study, we created a user manual for PBFDroid, you can find it [here](https://sy8pzmhmun.feishu.cn/docx/EIEsdCDFKoBIz1x17uuc2DyqnNc?from=from_copylink)).
